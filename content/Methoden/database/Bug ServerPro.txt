To bypasse an IPWhitelist from server.pro the only thing you should
do is go asking for servers until they give you one with the same ip
when you have it you put bungeecord you put the owner's nick
you go to the configuration of the bungeecord you place the ip and the port dela modality
from the server that you are going to grifar you enter through the bungeecord and BOOM! Bypassed
